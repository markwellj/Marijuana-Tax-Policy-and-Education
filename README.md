# Marijuana-Tax-Policy-and-Education

**Undergraduate Project**

- This project examined if the contributions to the Colorado Building Excellent Schools Today (BEST) program from the marijuana excise tax make a material impact on the performance of students attending recipient schools. 

- The Building Excellent Schools Today Program (BEST) receives tax revenues from the marijuana excise tax and grants it to schools in order to help with capital construction costs. 

- The coding was performed in STATA and three fixed effects regression models were used.

- The results were inconclusive regarding if the BEST program caused a material impact on student performance. 

- The corresponding report is also included in this repository.

- This project was a joint study with my then research partner, Devin Hayes. Devin now holds a J.D. from Washington University, St. Louis and is a practing attonry in Missouri.
